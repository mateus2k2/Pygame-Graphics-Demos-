# Ball

Ball presents texture mapping on a sphere in 3D space using Python, NumPy and CPU for calculations and pygame for display. There are two solutions, each with their advatages and drawbacks.

See https://oldskoolpython.blogspot.com/2021/11/texture-mapping-on-sphere.html for more on the inner workings of the code.

[Note: Originally added 2021. Minor bug fixes due to deprecated NumPy data types in Nov 2023.]
