# RealTime3DwithPython/Vector3D

Real time 3D vector graphics with Python, old skool Amiga Demo style. This is a project to develop a 3D vector city with light source and shadows. See also https://oldskoolpython.blogspot.com/

There are eight Python source files, each building on the previous file to complete the project in file number 8. XML files are used to define the 3D city.

[Note: Originally added 2020. Minor bug fixes due to deprecated NumPy data types in Nov 2023.]
