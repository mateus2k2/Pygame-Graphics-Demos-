# Space Invaders

Space Invaders, the classic game (1978) in Python. The graphics are either "free from the internet" (no copyright/licence claims) or purchased cheaply, like the sound effects. In any case you should not re-use/distribute them, but the code is free.

See https://oldskoolpython.blogspot.com/2022/01/space-invaders-game.html for some more details on the game.

[Note: Originally added 2022. Minor bug fixes due to deprecated NumPy data types in Nov 2023.]
