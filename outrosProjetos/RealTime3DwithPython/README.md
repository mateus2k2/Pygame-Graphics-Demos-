# RealTime3DwithPython
Real time 3D vector graphics with Python, old skool Amiga Demo style. And some other stuff. See https://oldskoolpython.blogspot.com/

There are 14 directories:
* Vector3D: A project to develop a 3D vector city with a light source and shadows. 
* Landscape: Fractal Landscapes with mouse controlled zooming.
* Sound Vision: A Python reproduction of a 1992 Amiga demo "Sound Vision" by Reflect.
* Game of Life: A simple Game of Life study using Numpy and Pygame.
* RGB Sphere: A spherical vector object shaded with three independent (red, green, blue) light sources. 
* Jelly Cubes: Two cubes rotating inside each other, showing the cuts where one protrudes the other.
* Texture Mapping: Real-Time Affine Texture Mapping of images to 3D rotating convex flat surfaces.
* Ball: Texture mapping on a 3D rotating sphere.
* Space Invaders: The classic 1978 arcade game in Python.
* Maze Generator: A program generating and drawing 2D mazes.
* Maze Solver: Solves mazes generated by Maze Generator.
* RayCasting_Map: Ray casting to a map.
* RayCasting_Game: Ray casting, full screen - the game.
* Cubester: A Rubik's Cube simulator.

[Note: Updated most of the directories originally added 2020 - 2022 in Nov 2023. Minor bug fixes due to deprecated NumPy data types, and replacing the original Amiga MOD music files with the same converted to OGG. Apparently, Pygame has lost the ability to play Amiga MODs in one of the updates.]
