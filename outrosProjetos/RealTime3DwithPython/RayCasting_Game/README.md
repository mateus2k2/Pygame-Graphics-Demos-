# RayCasting - the Game

RayCasting - the Game presents a ray cast environment in "almost 3D" like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom and their kind in the '90s. There is a simple editable map and the images used for texture mapping can easily be changed. The player may move freely in the dungeon-type space. In the game all coins should be collected before light runs out! A map helps navigating in the dungeon.

All calculations are made with NumPy and the basic aim is to process as big chunks of data at a time as possible, limiting the time spent looping the loops with Python. See more in my blog: https://oldskoolpython.blogspot.com/2022/07/ray-casting-game.html
