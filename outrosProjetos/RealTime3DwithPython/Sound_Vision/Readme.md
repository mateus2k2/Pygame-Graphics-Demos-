# RealTime3DwithPython/Sound Vision

A Python reproduction of a 1992 Amiga demo "Sound Vision" by Reflect. See https://archive.assembly.org/1992/amiga-demo/sound-vision-by-reflect

The demo consists of eleven independent parts. The credits for the pictures and music are given in the demo, only the code is mine. See also my blog at https://oldskoolpython.blogspot.com/2021/05/sound-vision-demo-in-python.html

To run the whole demo, run SoundVision.py. All the other files should be in the same directory. Use "f" key to toggle full screen mode on / off. Adjust screen resolution and frame rate at the end of SoundVision.py.

[Note: Originally added 2021. Minor bug fixes due to deprecated NumPy data types in Nov 2023.]
