# Texture Mapping

Texture Mapping does real-time affine texture mapping on convex flat surfaces in 3D space using Python, NumPy and CPU for calculations (each pixel calculated in this module) and pygame for display. There's a _tutorial mode_ which shows the mapping sections on both the original still image and the 3D rotated surface. (Set _self.tutorial_mode_ to True for tutorial mode.)
